  "body": "# Lumax - The XML Generator\r\n\r\n## Problem/Why ?\r\n\r\n - When you create an iconpack, the icon's name you give to pngs doesn't matches with the drawable name of appfilter.xml you recieve from icon request through email. \r\n - So then you have to manually change each value of darwable attribute in appfilter.xml and then create lots of other XMl files required by iconpack and sometimes you create lots of mistake. \r\n - lumax.jar will do that for you within a minute without any mistake.\r\n\r\n## What will I get ?\r\n**lumax.jar** generates five necessary XML files required by any iconpack.\r\n- appfilter.xml\r\n- appmap.xml\r\n- drawablle.xml\r\n- icon_pack.xml\r\n- theme_resources.xml\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n Works perfect with the **appfilter.xml** generated by icon request of [Polar Dashboard](https://github.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard), [IconShowcase](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/IconShowcase) and MaterialDashboard. May be it will work with other appfilter.xml files but I haven't tested it though.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\n You can download the **lumax.jar** from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mddanishansari/Lumax/master/lumax.jar)\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n Well it's simple.\r\n- You create a new folder named icons. Put all of your icons in it.\r\n- Have the appfilter.xml and lumax.jar outside icons folder.\r\n- Launch a command prompt or console window in that folder.\r\n- Pass a command `java -jar lumax.jar`\r\n- Then everything is self explanatory.\r\n\r\n Still have a doubt ?\r\n check out this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BI7NKvhtSA) \r\n\r\n## Beware\r\n\r\n There are somethings you must be aware of\r\n - You must have **Java JDK** installed on your system. Check this out [How to instll Java JDK ?](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/)\r\n - You must set **PATH** system variable environmentally in your system. [How to ?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)\r\n - **lumax.jar** generates only body part of the files because as you will use this again and again so removing the header part and footer part and then pasting it into your final appfilter.xml will make your work too hectic.\r\n - So better copy all code and paste it directly.\r\n - While writing numbers for each app, write numbers only(not decimal numbers or any strings) otherwise it will create datatype error. Type only -1 to skip particular icon.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nYou think there is problem somewhere, please feel free to open an issue in this repository.\r\n\r\n## Open source\r\n\r\n**lumax.jar** is open source, so you can download the source code from this repository and play with it in whatever way you want.\r\n\r\n## Thank you\r\n\r\n",
